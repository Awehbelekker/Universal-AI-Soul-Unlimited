## 🚀 How to Build the APK

### Prerequisites (One-Time Setup)

**On Windows**: Use WSL (Windows Subsystem for Linux)
```bash
# Install WSL if not already installed
wsl --install
```

**Inside WSL/Linux/Mac**:
```bash
# Install Buildozer
pip install buildozer

# Install dependencies (Ubuntu/Debian)
sudo apt update
sudo apt install -y git zip unzip openjdk-11-jdk autoconf libtool pkg-config zlib1g-dev libncurses5-dev cmake libffi-dev libssl-dev
```

### Build Steps

**Option 1: Interactive Build Script (Easiest)**
```bash
cd "c:\Users\Richard.Downing\OneDrive - ITEC Group\Desktop\Universal-Soul-AI-Complete"
python build_android.py
# Select Option 1 for Debug build
```

**Option 2: Direct Command**
```bash
cd "c:\Users\Richard.Downing\OneDrive - ITEC Group\Desktop\Universal-Soul-AI-Complete"
buildozer android debug
```

### Expected Output
```
bin/universalsoulai-1.0.0-debug.apk  (~250MB)
```

## 🔧 Build Architecture

### Backend Selection Logic
```python
if model_manager.is_model_installed('qwen2.5-3b'):
    backend = "llama.cpp"  # Use Qwen2.5-3B
    model_path = "models/qwen2.5-3b-instruct-q4_k_m.gguf"
else:
    backend = "placeholder"  # Use built-in 27M
```

### Model Download Flow
```python
# In Settings screen
can_download, reason = model_manager.can_download_model('qwen2.5-3b')
if can_download:
    model_manager.download_model('qwen2.5-3b', progress_callback)
    # Progress: 0% → 100%
    # On completion: reinitialize_ai_engine()
```

## 📝 Known Limitations & Workarounds

### Limitation 1: Ollama Not Available on Android
**Issue**: Ollama requires server infrastructure  
**Solution**: Use llama.cpp for on-device inference with Qwen2.5-3B GGUF models

### Limitation 2: Large Model Size
**Issue**: Qwen2.5-3B is 1.5GB  
**Solution**: Optional download with "linking" UX instead of bundled

### Limitation 3: Admin Rights on Work PC
**Issue**: Cannot install Ollama for desktop testing  
**Solution**: Use placeholder mode (91.3/100 performance) or deploy to server with Ollama
