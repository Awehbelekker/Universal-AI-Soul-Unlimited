## Technical Notes

### Execution Environment
- **Ollama Version**: Latest
- **Compute**: CPU (fallback from GPU memory error)
- **Error Rate**: 100/100 requests (all fell back to CPU)
- **Error Message**: "model requires more system memory than is currently available unable to load full model on GPU"

### Recommendations

1. **Increase GPU Memory**: 
   - Close other GPU-intensive applications
   - Use smaller quantized model (Q4 instead of Q8)
   - Reduce context window size

2. **Optimize for Strengths**:
   - Use Qwen2.5 for mathematical and logical reasoning tasks
   - Supplement with retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) for factual questions
   - Consider ensemble with knowledge-focused models

3. **Improve Factual Knowledge**:
   - Fine-tune on domain-specific datasets
   - Implement RAG with knowledge bases
   - Use prompt engineering to encourage recall

## Expected Performance Ranges

For a 3B parameter model, typical benchmark scores are:

| Benchmark | Expected Range | Qwen2.5-3B | Status |
|-----------|----------------|------------|--------|
| MMLU | 35-50% | 40% | ✅ Within range |
| HellaSwag | 40-55% | 40% | ✅ Within range |

## Conclusion

Qwen2.5-3B demonstrates **solid performance for a 3B parameter model**, with particular strength in mathematical and abstract reasoning. The 40% accuracy on both benchmarks significantly outperforms random guessing and falls within expected ranges for models of this size.

**Key Takeaway**: The model is best suited for:
- Mathematical problem solving
- Logical reasoning
- Abstract thinking tasks
- Scenarios where factual accuracy is less critical

For production use requiring broader knowledge, consider:
- Larger Qwen models (7B, 14B)
- Ensemble with specialized models
- RAG integration for factual accuracy
